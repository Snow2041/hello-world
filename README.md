# hello-world
This is my introduction to the GitHub world
I am a learner and teacher. I love to share and collaborate. My rubber-duckie and I look forward to the coding challenges ahead.
(～￣▽￣)～ This is my rubber-duckie, Duckie. I talk to him and he talks to me.
But it looks like I have been here before. If this is my introduction to the Git world, yet it feels familiar here, then it seems possible that me and my duckie have been here before.
So what if 2 commits are made at the same time? Can they be Pulled together? As may have happened to me? Since I have been here before and am here now, can we become one with the Git Community?

Correcting conflicts, delete duplicates add conjuction type of code so the program is smooth and understandable. It is very much like editing a MadLib that multiple people work on. MadLibs were great fun, so is coding.
