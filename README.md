# hello-world
This is my introduction to the GitHub world
I am a learner and teacher. I love to share and collaborate. My rubber-duckie and I look forward to the coding challenges ahead.
But it looks like I have been here before. If this is my introduction to the Git world, yet it feels familiar here, then it seems possible that me and my duckie have been here before.
(～￣▽￣)～ This is my rubber-duckie, Duckie. I talk to him and he talks to me.
